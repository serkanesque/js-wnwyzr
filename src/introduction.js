The links between religion and corporal punishment of children</h2>\n          <p>Corporal punishment of children occurs globally and in all societies. It takes place in many settings including\nthe home, in schools and institutions, care systems such as foster and day care, and on the streets. In some\ncountries children and young people can still be legally whipped or beaten as punishment for an offence.\nChildren in situations such as forced or bonded labour, domestic labour, or those being abused in prostitution\nand trafficking are also at risk.</p>\n<p>\nThe mistaken belief that corporal punishment is an effective form of discipline for children is widespread,\nand many people do not view corporal punishment as the act of violence that it is. This attitude is not only\nheld by individuals but is widespread in societies and endorsed at state government level. Religious views often\nunderpin this belief with reliance by some communities on particular interpretations of their religious texts.\nSome societies retain the use of corporal punishment in traditional\njustice systems and through religious law such as Shariah or Muslim\nlaw. Although many states have developed child protection laws they\ncontinue to authorise corporal punishment of children. \n</p>\n<p>\nReligious justification for corporal punishment is complex and\npresents a challenge for those campaigning for law reform. For centuries\nreligious teachings and various theological positions held by some\nreligious groups have been used to justify corporal punishment, and the\ncultural environment of different religious communities has reinforced\nthe practice. In some cases the justification of corporal punishment\nmay be based on a literal reading and interpretation of ancient religious\ntexts.</p>\n<p>\nSome groups of Christians believe in the notion of \u201Coriginal sin\u201D \u2013 a\nbelief that all children are born inherently bad and that it is therefore\nthe duty of parents to control the child\u2019s behaviour and \u201Cbreak the\nchild\u2019s will\u201D through physical punishment. This attitude towards\nchildren, when coupled with a belief that the Bible is beyond criticism\nand contains divine instructions to physically punish children, means\nthat all the compelling research evidence and advances in child\ndevelopment which condemn physical punishment make little impact.\n</p>      </div>\n\n<div>\n            <h2 id=\"religion-and-the-law\">2.Religion and the law</h2>\n            <p>Corporal punishment occurs across all cultures and\nreligions and the tension between modern laws and\nindigenous, religious and traditional customs and\nauthoritarian practices continues to hinder legal\nreform and policies for the protection of children.\nLack of awareness of policies, rules and regulations\nmaintains the situation. Even in largely secular\nsocieties corporal punishment of children is often\ndeeply rooted in cultural and traditional beliefs\nand practices. Violence against children, including\ncorporal punishment, is also linked to inequality\nin some societies where discrimination based on\ncaste, gender, disability and/or social class increases\nchildren\u2019s vulnerability to violence. Children are\nusually at the bottom of hierarchical social structures and the last to receive justice.  </p>\n            <p>Traditional common law defences allow parents and other adults the right to use \u201Creasonable punishment\u201D\nor \u201Clawful correction\u201D against children. In some countries these defences are written into the law; in others the\nlaw is silent but corporal punishment is accepted. Many countries have adopted the ancient English common\nlaw defence of \u201Creasonable chastisement\u201D which spread throughout the world during the nineteenth century\nlargely through colonisation, military occupation and some Christian missionary teaching. Prohibiting all\ncorporal punishment requires the explicit removal of all such defences. </p>\n            <p>For centuries corporal punishment has carried with it the mask of religious credibility in religious schools,\ninstitutions and family homes. But in recent times it has been widely exposed as dangerous and unjust and\nincompatible with the teachings of the major world\nreligions. As evidence of past institutional and\nfamily abuse has come to light, men and women\nwho endured corporal punishment in childhood\nhave revealed their deep sense of humiliation and\nspoken about the trauma and psychological damage\nthey sustained. Others have trivialised childhood\nexperiences of being hurt by parents and teachers,\nout of loyalty to their parents. As adults they may\ngo to great lengths to protect their parents from\npainful memories of being physically punished as\nchildren. They may hide their true feelings with the\ncomment: \u201CIt never did me any harm \u2013 it made me\nthe person I am today.\u201D  </p>\n            <p>The persistent social and legal acceptance of corporal punishment as a form of discipline or \u201Ccorrection\u201D, and\nits acceptance by adults and children as an inevitable part of childhood, means that this violence often goes\nunreported. But corporal punishment is never acceptable. It breaches children\u2019s fundamental human rights to\nequal protection and its legality means that children, the smallest and most vulnerable people in society, have\nless protection from assault than adults. </p>\n            </div>\n\n\n<div>\n            <h2 id=\"religion-and-reform\">3.Religion and reform</h2>\n<p>Hitting children and causing them pain is incompatible with the values expressed in most religious teachings,\nwhich are very similar to the human rights principles of respect for human dignity, equality, justice and\nnon-violence. Religious values helped inform the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and generations of\nreligious leaders and scholars have played a significant role in defending human rights. These universal values\nare shared by most religious communities and a growing number of religious leaders have recognised the need\nto highlight and put them into action towards eliminating all corporal punishment of children.</p>\n<p>Religious leaders at a global consultation in Toledo, Spain, in 2006 acknowledged that many faith-based\ninstitutions have been responsible for acts of violence against children. They recommended that leaders of\nthe major world religions should address the problem as a matter of urgency. Their recommendations and\ncommitments were incorporated into a declaration (the Kyoto Declaration) endorsed at the Eighth World\nAssembly of Religions for Peace held in Kyoto, Japan in 2006. It states:</p>\n<block-quote>\n\u201CWe must acknowledge that our religious communities have not fully upheld their obligations to\nprotect our children from violence. Through omission, denial and silence, we have at times tolerated,\nperpetuated and ignored the reality of violence against children in homes, families, institutions and\ncommunities, and not actively confronted the suffering that this violence causes. Even as we have not\nfully lived up to our responsibilities in this regard, we believe that religious communities must be part\nof the solution to eradicating violence against children, and we commit ourselves to take leadership in\nour religious communities and the broader society.\u201D\n</block-quote>\n            </div>\n      \n\n<div>\n            <h2 id=\"religious-leaders-have-a-key-role-to-play\">4.Religious leaders have a key role to play </h2>\n<p>Five billion of the world\u2019s six billion people are said to profess a religious belief. As members of one of the\nlargest groups in society, religious leaders are in a position to engage with communities and to mobilise multireligious action to end all forms of violence against children, including corporal punishment. </p>\n<p>Religious leaders often have extensive local, regional, national and global networks which provide\nopportunities for raising awareness and changing attitudes within and beyond their local communities. They\nare in a unique position to be advocates for children and agents for change.</p>\n<p>While some religious leaders continue to teach their communities that corporal punishment of children\nis natural or even a duty in childrearing, a growing number of religious leaders publicly acknowledge that\ncorporal punishment is at odds with and debases their religious principles and core religious beliefs. Many are\ninvolved in the movement for the elimination and prohibition of corporal punishment and regard ending this\ninjustice towards children as a religious imperative. </p>\n<p>The above mentioned Kyoto Declaration was endorsed by more than 800 religious leaders from all the\nmajor world religions. As its preamble states:</p>\n<block-quote>\u201CWe find strong consensus across our religious traditions about the inherent dignity of every person,\nincluding children. This requires that we reject all forms of violence against children and protect and\npromote the sanctity of life in every stage of a child\u2019s development...\"</block-quote>\n            </div>\n\n\n    "]);_templateObject_eddb5be02caa11ea91a843ae9cba1c4a=function _templateObject_eddb5be02caa11ea91a843ae9cba1c4a(){return data};return data}var IntroductionContent=/*#__PURE__*/function(_PolymerElement){babelHelpers.inherits(IntroductionContent,_PolymerElement);function IntroductionContent(){babelHelpers.classCallCheck(this,IntroductionContent);return babelHelpers.possibleConstructorReturn(this,babelHelpers.getPrototypeOf(IntroductionContent).apply(this,arguments))}babelHelpers.createClass(IntroductionContent,[{key:"ready",value:function ready(){babelHelpers.get(babelHelpers.getPrototypeOf(IntroductionContent.prototype),"ready",this).call(this)}}],[{key:"template",get:function get(){return(0,_polymerElement.html)(_templateObject_eddb5be02caa11ea91a843ae9cba1c4a())}}]);return IntroductionContent}(_polymerElement.PolymerElement);window.customElements.define("introduction-content",IntroductionContent)});
