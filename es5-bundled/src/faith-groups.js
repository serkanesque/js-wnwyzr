The views of religious leaders can\ncontribute towards shaping important debates and achieving justice and human rights. </p>\n         <p>Many religious leaders exercise power and influence in both the religious and secular spheres at local,\nregional, national and international levels and through their extensive networks. Religious leaders are also\nuniquely positioned to make an effective contribution towards achieving reform to end corporal punishment\nthrough their various roles and functions. They usually have insights and detailed knowledge of their\ncommunities and contact with people at many points in their lives. It is important to engage with religious\nleaders who are already taking a leadership role on children\u2019s rights and to encourage their involvement in\nnational strategies to achieve law reform to prohibit corporal punishment of children. </p>\n         <p>Religious communities may be unaware of the involvement of\nothers working towards eliminating corporal punishment. Building on\nmutual respect and trust, organisations can work together to provide\nopportunities for diverse faith communities to receive information,\nresources and encouragement to become actively engaged with the issue.</p>\n         <p>This section looks at opportunities available for engaging religious\nsupport and expertise through existing structures, including religious\norganisations and networks. It discusses the importance of multireligious collaboration between religious groups and between religious\ngroups and other organisations, gives examples of faith-based action\nand advocacy, makes suggestions for further action and discusses ways\nof ensuring children\u2019s participation. The following section (Section 6)\nconsiders in more detail how efforts to prohibit and eliminate corporal\npunishment of children can be furthered through the everyday roles\nand functions of religious leaders.</p>\n\n\n\n            <h2 id=\"Engaging-with-faith-based-groups\">Engaging with faith-based groups</h2>\n         <p>Faith-based groups are multi-faceted. They include religious leaders and organisations such as charities\nand welfare organisations, local religious congregations and religious institutions, theological colleges and\nuniversity departments, schools and religious orders</p>\n  <p>Many faith-based organisations are concerned with supporting children and families. Leaders from\ndifferent religious traditions may also serve as chaplains or counsellors in prisons, hospitals, schools,\nuniversities and places of work</p>\n  <p>Religious leaders often fulfill roles and duties in the public sphere, placing them in a unique position\nto promote dialogue and cooperation between different religious groups, community organisations and\ngovernment bodies towards eliminating violence against children. Historically many religious leaders have\nmade a stand for justice and human rights.</p>\n    <p>Gaining the support and active involvement of religious leaders and their communities is a crucial\ncomponent of efforts to prohibit and eliminate corporal punishment of children. It is important to create\nopportunities to listen to supportive religious leaders and seek their advice on the best ways to engage\nwith religious communities. The Kyoto Declaration and the report of the UN Secretary-General\u2019s Study\non Violence against Children (see Section 3) can be used to highlight concerns and form a framework for\nmeetings and events to create awareness, provide information and develop a plan of action.</p>\n<h4>Building partnerships</h4>\n<p>Investing in partnerships and coalitions with religious communities and organisations brings a broader\ndimension to eliminating violence against children. It can have a powerful influence as people of faith unite\nbehind a common goal. Working in solidarity enables different communities to learn from each other,\nstrengthen commitment and take action. The sharing of information, resources and training can enlarge the\ncapacity of religious, traditional and indigenous groups to address the issue of corporal punishment</p>\n<p>Many mosques, temples, synagogues, churches and houses of worship have extensive local, regional and\nglobal networks. They have long-standing links with education and youth networks and are traditionally\ninvolved in charitable work and service provision. Many are in touch with some of the most marginalised\npeople and those who are isolated from other services. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"Developing-multi-religious-support\">Developing multi-religious support</h2>\n         <p>Investing in partnerships with religious communities to work towards a common goal can help recognise\nthe skills and expertise of religious communities. When people from different religions come together with\na common purpose and speak with one voice they can be a powerful influence in changing attitudes and\nachieving reform. </p>\n           <p>Women are often under-represented in religious leadership roles and multi-religious gatherings. It is\nimportant to find ways of engaging with women of faith to ensure they are included in all meetings and\ndecision-making processes. </p>\n             <p>Multi-religious action can take place at local, regional, national and international levels. For example,\nglobal organisations and networks can provide opportunities at conferences and workshops to develop joint\ndeclarations, recommendations and statements supporting legal reform. </p>\n               \n\n</div>\n\n\n    "]);_templateObject_edcdee602caa11ea91a843ae9cba1c4a=function _templateObject_edcdee602caa11ea91a843ae9cba1c4a(){return data};return data}var FaithGroups=/*#__PURE__*/function(_PolymerElement){babelHelpers.inherits(FaithGroups,_PolymerElement);function FaithGroups(){babelHelpers.classCallCheck(this,FaithGroups);return babelHelpers.possibleConstructorReturn(this,babelHelpers.getPrototypeOf(FaithGroups).apply(this,arguments))}babelHelpers.createClass(FaithGroups,[{key:"ready",value:function ready(){babelHelpers.get(babelHelpers.getPrototypeOf(FaithGroups.prototype),"ready",this).call(this)}},{key:"scrollIntoView",value:function scrollIntoView(e){var sectionId=e.target.getAttribute("section-id");this.shadowRoot.querySelector("#"+sectionId+"").scrollIntoView()}}],[{key:"template",get:function get(){return(0,_polymerElement.html)(_templateObject_edcdee602caa11ea91a843ae9cba1c4a())}}]);return FaithGroups}(_polymerElement.PolymerElement);window.customElements.define("faith-groups",FaithGroups)});
