Under Article 39, States must provide support to children\nwho are victims of violence. The CRC requires school discipline to be \u201Cconsistent with the child\u2019s human\ndignity and in conformity with the present Convention\u201D (Article 28.2) \u2013 that is, without using corporal\npunishment</p>\n            <p>The Committee on the Rights of the Child \u2013 the monitoring body for the CRC \u2013 has identified certain\nrights in the CRC as general principles underpinning all rights in the Convention. There are four such general\nprinciples. In all actions concerning children, the best interests of the child should be a primary consideration\n(Article 3). Every child has an inherent right to life,\nsurvival and development (Article 6) and to nondiscrimination (Article 2). And all children have the\nright to express their views freely in all matters affecting\nthem and to have their views given due weight (Article\n12).</p>\n\n\n <h2 id=\"UN-Committee-on-the-Rights-of-the-Child\">2.UN Committee on the Rights of the Child</h2>\n        <p>The Committee on the Rights of the Child monitors implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the\nChild. It is the highest international authority for interpretation of the Convention. Elected by States Parties\nto the Convention, the 18-member body meets three times a year in Geneva. States Parties must submit an\ninitial report on progress towards implementation of the Convention within two years of ratification; then\nperiodic reports must be submitted every five years.</p>\n          <p>The Committee has consistently stated that legal and social acceptance of physical punishment of children,\nin the home, institutions and all other settings, is not compatible with the Convention. Since 1993, in its\nrecommendations following examination of states\u2019 reports on their efforts to implement the Convention the\nCommittee has recommended prohibition of physical punishment in the family, in all types of institutions,\ncare settings and as a sentence of the courts, together with education campaigns to encourage positive, nonviolent childrearing and education. In examining states\u2019 reports, the Committee has singled out for particular\ncriticism national laws that allow some level of violent punishment justified as \u201Creasonable chastisement\u201D or\n\u201Cmoderate correction.\u201D</p>\n\n    \n <h2 id=\"Other-international-and-regional-human-rights-treaties\">3. Other international and regional human rights treaties</h2>\n        <p>The prohibition of all corporal punishment is required by other international human rights treaties, including\nthe Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social\nand Cultural Rights. In December 2008, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution on the rights of\nthe child which urged States to take legislative measures to prohibit all forms of violence against children in\nall settings, to change attitudes which \u201Ccondone or normalize\u201D violence against children, including \u201Ccruel,\ninhuman or degrading forms of discipline\u201D, and to promote positive discipline in the home, schools, and care\nand justice systems. </p>  \n     <p>Regional human rights treaty bodies also support prohibition and there are high level court judgments in\na growing number of states condemning corporal punishment. For example, in 1982, the European Human\nRights Commission declared inadmissible an application to the European Court of Human Rights in which\nSwedish parents alleged that the prohibition of physical punishment by parents breached their rights to\nrespect for family life and to freedom of religion as guaranteed in articles 8 and 9 of the European Convention\non Human Rights. The parents believed that their Protestant Christian faith and particular Biblical texts\nsupported the use of corporal punishment.</p>  \n          \n   \n\n\n</div>\n\n\n    "]);_templateObject_edc95a802caa11ea91a843ae9cba1c4a=function _templateObject_edc95a802caa11ea91a843ae9cba1c4a(){return data};return data}var ChildrensRights=/*#__PURE__*/function(_PolymerElement){babelHelpers.inherits(ChildrensRights,_PolymerElement);function ChildrensRights(){babelHelpers.classCallCheck(this,ChildrensRights);return babelHelpers.possibleConstructorReturn(this,babelHelpers.getPrototypeOf(ChildrensRights).apply(this,arguments))}babelHelpers.createClass(ChildrensRights,[{key:"ready",value:function ready(){babelHelpers.get(babelHelpers.getPrototypeOf(ChildrensRights.prototype),"ready",this).call(this)}},{key:"scrollIntoView",value:function scrollIntoView(e){var sectionId=e.target.getAttribute("section-id");this.shadowRoot.querySelector("#"+sectionId+"").scrollIntoView()}}],[{key:"template",get:function get(){return(0,_polymerElement.html)(_templateObject_edc95a802caa11ea91a843ae9cba1c4a())}}]);return ChildrensRights}(_polymerElement.PolymerElement);window.customElements.define("childrens-rights",ChildrensRights)});
