The only way of getting a near-accurate picture of children\u2019s real experiences of corporal punishment\nis through interview research with children, with appropriate ethical safeguards. Information on violence\nagainst babies and small children can only be gained through interviews with parents in situations of trust and\nconfidentiality. The lack of visibility is one of the reasons why eliminating this commonplace form of violence\nagainst children has for too long had such a low priority</p>\n\n<p>But the visibility of corporal punishment is increasing, with a growing number of research studies revealing\nthe extent and enormity of the problem. According to statistics from UNICEF on child discipline in 35\nlow- and middle-income countries, in 2005-2006 three out of four children aged 2-14 experienced physical\npunishment and/or psychological aggression in their homes during the month before the survey, ranging from\n38% in Bosnia and Herzegovina to almost 95% in Yemen. The rate of violent discipline was above 70% in\nthree quarters of the countries surveyed and above 80% in half of them; Bosnia and Herzegovina was the only\ncountry with a rate below 50%.</p>\n<p>There have been many other national studies. For example, qualitative research with over 500 children in\nCambodia revealed that over 80% were punished in the home, commonly with implements including sticks,\nelectric cables, belts and chains.13 In 2005, Tearfund, a leading charity working in partnership with Christian\nagencies and churches worldwide to address poverty and injustice, conducted a large scale study of children\u2019s\nattitudes towards and experiences of corporal punishment in Cambodia: most children believed that being\nbeaten by teachers and parents was acceptable in some circumstances, and in a survey of more than 1,300 12-15\nyear olds, 51% of the boys and 36% of the girls reported being beaten by their parents, 35% and 24% by their\nteachers.</p>\n\n     <h2 id=\"the-impact-of-corporal-punishment\">2.The impact of corporal punishment</h2>\n     <p>Corporal punishment violates a child\u2019s physical, emotional and spiritual integrity. The impact of corporal\npunishment is often discussed in terms of physical, psychological, behavioural and societal consequences but\nit is difficult to separate these as they may each in turn have an impact on the other. Physical injury such as\ndamage to a child\u2019s developing brain can have a psychological impact such as cognitive delay or emotional\ndifficulties. Behavioural effects may lead to alcohol and drug abuse. Corporal punishment can have short and\nlong-term effects on development and health which not only impact on the child and family but ultimately on\nsociety as a whole, including welfare, mental health and justice systems.</p>\n\n<h4>Physical effects</h4>\n<p>Children who are physically punished may suffer injuries which leave permanent damage. Tragically, corporal\npunishment causes the death of a significant number of children every year.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Boxing on the ear can damage the ear drum.</li>\n<li>Shaking can cause whiplash injury, blindness,brain damage or even death.</li>\n<li>Hitting can injure the sciatic nerve, pelvis, coccyx, genitals or spine.</li>\n<li>Hitting a child\u2019s hands can injure bones, blood vessels, joints and ligaments and can cause premature osteoarthritis</li>\n<li>A child who is hit can accidentally fall or be pushed over and suffer serious injury</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Effects on growth and development</h4>\n<p>Corporal punishment can have serious negative effects on the growth and development of the child. There is\nevidence to suggest that exposure to violence in early childhood alters the developing brain by interfering with\nnormal neuro-developmental processes.</p>\n<p>In his paper Violence and Childhood, How Persisting Fear Can Alter the Developing Child\u2019s Brain (2001),\nBruce Perry considers one of the many perspectives from which to examine the impact of violence on children,\nviolence-related neurodevelopmental changes and functional consequences. He states: \u201C\u2026 Exposure to violence\nactivates a set of threat responses in the child\u2019s developing brain; in turn, excess activation of the neural systems\ninvolved in the threat responses can alter the developing brain; these alterations may manifest as functional\nchanges in emotional, behavioural and cognitive functioning. The roots of violence-related problems, therefore,\ncan be found in the adaptive responses to threat, present during the violent experiences.\u201D </p>\n\n\n<h4>Psychological effects</h4>\n<p>Corporal punishment can be psychologically damaging and may induce a sense of low self worth, sadness, fear,\nshame, anger, an inability to trust, anxiety, despair, depression or withdrawal. Depression may induce a person\nto abuse alcohol or use illicit drugs.</p>\n\n<h4>Effects on behaviour</h4>\n<p>Studies have repeatedly demonstrated that both girls and boys who have been physically abused before the age of five have\nbeen found to be aggressive and have difficulty with managing their behaviour and forming peer relationships in later childhood and\ninto adolescence, even when the abuse has ceased</p>\n\n<h4>Effects on society</h4>\n<p>Research involving adults has shown\nthat having been physically punished\nin childhood is associated with later\nantisocial and criminal behaviour\nand adult abuse of one\u2019s own child\nor spouse; physical punishment was\nalso negatively associated with mental\nhealth.42 The consequences and costs\nfor society in both the short and\nlong-term include those associated\nwith childcare, welfare, mental health\nand justice systems.</p>\n\n  <h2 id=\"the-importance-of-legal-reform\">3.The importance of legal reform</h2>\n          <p>Prohibiting corporal punishment by law is a vital measure which recognises a child\u2019s human rights to respect\nfor human dignity and physical integrity and to equal protection under the law. Law reform provides a clear\nbasis for child protection. It makes it clear to all people working with and caring for children, including child\nand family organisations, faith-based organisations, education providers and employers, that hitting a child is\nno more lawful or acceptable than hitting anyone else. Law reform should be accompanied by public education\nto raise awareness of children\u2019s rights and to provide information for parents, teachers and others about\npositive, non-violent forms of discipline</p>\n           <p>It is important to emphasise that the\naim of law reform is not to prosecute\nparents for a \u201Cmild smack\u201D. The primary\npurpose of the law is to set a standard\nand work towards changing attitudes\nand practices so that children can\ngrow and develop free from the fear of\nviolence. Given children\u2019s dependent\nstatus, and the unique relationships\nwithin the family, prosecution of parents should happen only if it is considered necessary to protect the child from significant harm and to be in\nthe child\u2019s best interests. </p>\n            <p>Although governments have a primary obligation to protect children, all adults have a responsibility to end\nviolence against children. Religious leaders, faith-based organisations and community groups can play a key\npart in working together to support parents, carers and teachers and to give guidance on non-violent discipline.\nAbove all, religious leaders can be role models and lead by example: by treating children with respect and\ncompassion and actively promoting non-violence they set a standard for others to follow. Ending all corporal\npunishment is a key step towards eliminating all other forms of violence against children. This requires law\nreform and other measures.</p>\n             <p>No country can say it has prohibited corporal punishment in all settings until it has passed legislation which\ndoes this. And in order to make a difference to children\u2019s daily lives that legislation must be accompanied by\nimplementation and prevention strategies, including public education on positive non-violent discipline.</p>\n  \n\n\n  <h2 id=\"progress-towards-prohibition-worldwide\">4. Progress towards prohibition worldwide</h2>\n<p>Corporal punishment of children is a global problem and children in almost every state in the world endure\nthe humiliation and pain of being hit by adults. Because acceptance of corporal punishment is so widespread\nand frequently institutionalised, politicians and others often fail to view the problem of corporal punishment\nas one of equality and human rights</p>\n<p>The recommendations of the United Nations Secretary-General\u2019s Study on Violence against Children\n(2006) urged all states to take urgent action to prohibit all forms of violence against children, including\ncorporal punishment.</p>\n<p>During the last decade there\nhas been significant global progress\ntowards achieving prohibition.\nBy the end of December 2010,\n29 countries worldwide had\nenacted legislation which prohibits\ncorporal punishment of children\nin all settings, including within\nthe family. Governments in at least\nanother 23 countries have made a\ncommitment to prohibition and/\nor are considering Bills in their\nparliaments. But the majority of\nchildren are not yet protected from\nall corporal punishment in their homes, with 95.5% of the global child population living in countries where it\nis lawful for parents to hit them in the name of \u201Cdiscipline\u201D.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>\n\n\n    "]);_templateObject_edd0d4902caa11ea91a843ae9cba1c4a=function _templateObject_edd0d4902caa11ea91a843ae9cba1c4a(){return data};return data}var GlobalProblem=/*#__PURE__*/function(_PolymerElement){babelHelpers.inherits(GlobalProblem,_PolymerElement);function GlobalProblem(){babelHelpers.classCallCheck(this,GlobalProblem);return babelHelpers.possibleConstructorReturn(this,babelHelpers.getPrototypeOf(GlobalProblem).apply(this,arguments))}babelHelpers.createClass(GlobalProblem,[{key:"ready",value:function ready(){babelHelpers.get(babelHelpers.getPrototypeOf(GlobalProblem.prototype),"ready",this).call(this)}},{key:"scrollIntoView",value:function scrollIntoView(e){var sectionId=e.target.getAttribute("section-id");this.shadowRoot.querySelector("#"+sectionId+"").scrollIntoView()}}],[{key:"template",get:function get(){return(0,_polymerElement.html)(_templateObject_edd0d4902caa11ea91a843ae9cba1c4a())}}]);return GlobalProblem}(_polymerElement.PolymerElement);window.customElements.define("global-problem",GlobalProblem)});
